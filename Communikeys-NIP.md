# [Communikeys](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#communikeys)

Defines a standard for creating, managing and publishing to communities by leveraging existing key pairs and relays.

This approach uniquely allows:

- Any existing npub to become a community (identity + manager)
- Any existing publication to be targeted at any community
- Communities to have their own selected content types

## [Motivation](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#motivation)

Current
 community management solutions on Nostr often require complex 
relay-specific implementations, lack proper decentralization and don't 
allow publications to be targeted at more than one community.

This 
proposal aims to simplify community management by utilizing existing 
Nostr primitives (key pairs and relays) while adding minimal new event 
kinds.

## [Community Creation Event (kind:10222)](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#community-creation-event-kind10222)

A 
community is created when a key pair publishes a [[kind-10222]] event. 
The pubkey of this key pair becomes the unique identifier for that 
community. One key pair can only represent one community.

The community's name, picture, and description are derived from the pubkey's [[kind-0]] metadata event.

```json
{
  "id": "<event-id>",
  "pubkey": "<community-pubkey>",
  "created_at": 1675642635,
  "kind": 10222,
  "tags": [
    // at least one main relay for the community + other optional backup relays
    ["r", "<relay-url>"],

    // one or more blossom servers
    ["blossom", "<blossom-url>"],

    // one or more ecash mints
    ["mint", "<mint-url>", "cashu"],

    // General section for comments, reactions, and labels (recommended for all communities)
    ["content", "General"],
    ["k", "1111"], // comments
    ["k", "7"],    // reactions
    ["k", "1985"], // labels
    ["a", "30000:<pubkey>:General", "<relay-url>"], // profile list with whitelisted pubkeys
    ["badge", "<badge-definition>"], // badge that grants interaction rights

    // one or more content sections for publishing
    ["content", "Chat"],
    ["k", "9"],
    ["a", "30000:<pubkey>:Chat", "<relay-url>"],
    ["badge", "<badge-definition>"],

    ["content", "Forum"],
    ["k", "11"],
    ["a", "30000:<pubkey>:Forum", "<relay-url>"],
    ["badge", "<badge-definition>"],

    ["content", "Apps"],
    ["k", "32267"],
    ["a", "30000:<pubkey>:Apps", "<relay-url>"],
    ["badge", "<badge-definition-member>"],
    ["badge", "<badge-definition-pro>"],
    ["badge", "<badge-definition-team>"],

    // Optional terms of service, points to another event
    ["tos", "<event-id-or-address>", "<relay-url>"],

    // Optional location
    ["location", "<location>"],
    ["g", "<geo-hash>"],

    // Optional description
    ["description", "A description text that overwrites the profile's description, if needed"]
  ],
  "content": "",
  "sig": "<signature>"
}
```

### [Tag definitions](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#tag-definitions)

| Tag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `r` | URLs of relays where community content should be published. First one is considered main relay. |
| `blossom` | (optional) URLs of blossom servers for additional community features. |
| `mint` | (optional) URL of community mint for token/payment features. |
| `content` | Name of Content Type section that the Communikey works with. |
| `k` | Event kind, within a content type section. |
| `a` | (within content section) Addressable reference to a profile list [[kind-30000]] containing all whitelisted pubkeys (`p` tags) for this content section. Format: `30000:<pubkey>:<d-tag>`. |
| `badge` | Badge requirement for publishing. References a Badge Definition event, see [[NIP-58]]. Format: `30009:<pubkey>:<d-tag>`. Multiple `badge` tags can be specified per content section — users holding any of these badges can publish. |
| `retention` | (optional) Retention policy in format [kind, value, type] where type is either "time" (seconds) or "count" (number of events). |
| `tos` | (optional) Reference to the community's posting policy. |
| `location` | (optional) Location of the community. |
| `g` | (optional) Geo hash of the community. |
| `description` | (optional) Description of the community. |

The pubkey of the key pair that creates this event serves as the unique identifier for the community. This means:

1. Each key pair can only represent one community
2. Communities can be easily discovered by querying for the most recent [[kind-10222]] event for a given pubkey
3. Community managers can update their settings by publishing a new [[kind-10222]] event

## [Community Identifier Format](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#community-identifier-format)

Communities can be referenced using an "ncommunity" format:

```
ncommunity://<pubkey>?relay=<url-encoded-relay-1>&relay=<url-encoded-relay-2>
```

This 
format follows the same principles as nprofile, but specifically for 
community identification. While the ncommunity format is recommended for
 complete relay information, the standard pubkey format can also be used
 when relay discovery is not needed.

## [Listing a User's Communities](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#listing-a-users-communities)

Since communities are just pubkeys, existing Nostr primitives can be used to list which communities a user is part of.

### [Profile Lists](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#profile-lists)

- **Follow list** [[kind-3]] — users can follow community pubkeys publicly, or privately in the encrypted content section
- **Bookmarks** [[kind-10003]] — users can bookmark community pubkeys publicly, or privately in the encrypted content section

Clients can filter these lists to show only pubkeys that have a [[kind-10222]] community definition event.

### [Community Badges](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#community-badges)

Clients
 can look at a user's accepted community badges in their Profile Badges 
[[kind-30008]] event. Badge Definitions can include a `p` tag specifying which community the badge belongs to, see [[NIP-58]]. 
This allows clients to automatically determine community membership from
 badge ownership.

## [Targeted Publication Event (kind:30222)](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#targeted-publication-event-kind30222)

To target an existing publication at specific communities, users create a [[kind-30222]] event:

```json
{
  "id": "<event-id>",
  "pubkey": "<pubkey>",
  "created_at": 1675642635,
  "kind": 30222,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<random-id>"],
    ["e", "<event-id-of-original-publication>"],
    ["k", "<kind-of-original-publication>"],
    ["p", "<community1-pubkey>"],
    ["r", "<main-relay1-url>"],
    ["p", "<community2-pubkey>"],
    ["r", "<main-relay2-url>"]
  ],
  "content": "",
  "sig": "<signature>"
}
```

The targeted publication event can reference the original publication in two ways:

1. Using an `e` tag with the event ID, relay hint, and pubkey hint
2. Using an `a` tag with the event address and relay hint

The `k` tag specifies the kind of the original publication, and the `p` tags list the communities that this publication is targeting.

Currently, we work with a maximum of 12 communities that can be tagged for one publication.

**Note:** For publishing new events, clients SHOULD create a targeted Publication
 event first (that only has an id) and reference it with an `h` tag in the main event.

## [Community-Exclusive Publications](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#community-exclusive-publications)

Chat 
messages [[kind-9]] and Forum posts [[kind-11]] are exclusive by 
default. They can only belong to one community and cannot be targeted to
 multiple communities.

For these exclusive content types, we don't need a Targeted Publication event. Instead, they use an `h` tag to reference their community directly.

For chat messages within a community, users should use [[kind-9]] events with a community tag:

```json
{
  "id": "<event-id>",
  "pubkey": "<pubkey>",
  "created_at": 1675642635,
  "kind": 9,
  "tags": [
    ["h", "<community-pubkey>"]
  ],
  "content": "<message>",
  "sig": "<signature>"
}
```

The same pattern applies to Forum posts, see [[kind-11]].

## [Badge-Based Access Control](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#badge-based-access-control)

Communities use [[NIP-58|Badges]] for publishing permissions. Each content section can have one or more `badge` tags referencing Badge Definitions. Users holding **any** of these badges can publish to that content section.

```json
["content", "Apps"],
["k", "32267"],
["a", "30000:community-pubkey:Apps"],
["badge", "30009:community-pubkey:member"],
["badge", "30009:community-pubkey:pro"],
["badge", "30009:community-pubkey:team"]
```

In this example, "Member", "Pro", and "Team" badge holders can all publish Apps.

Badge Definitions can include a `form` tag that references a Form Template, see [[kind-30168]] and 
[[NIP-101]]. Users request badges by submitting a Form Response 
[[kind-1069]] that references both the form and the badge. This allows 
communities to collect information from users before granting access.

### [Profile Lists](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#profile-lists)

Each content section includes an `a` tag referencing a profile list [[kind-30000]] containing `p` tags for all whitelisted pubkeys. This allows clients to fetch all 
allowed pubkeys in a single event, avoiding the need to query 
potentially hundreds of badge award events.

**Keeping lists in sync:** When awarding or revoking a badge, apps MUST also update the corresponding profile list. This can be handled by:

- **Automated systems:** A hot-key solution that processes badge requests and updates lists automatically
- **Manual admin interfaces:** Apps that let admins accept requests should both award the badge and update the profile list in one action

### [Delegated Badge Awarding](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#delegated-badge-awarding)

The pubkey that awards badges does **not** have to be the same as the community's pubkey. The `badge` tag in a content section simply references a Badge Definition — this badge can be created and awarded by any pubkey.

This enables important security patterns:

- **Separate award key:** Communities can use a dedicated pubkey for handling badge awards. This 
  key can run on a live server to process Form Responses without exposing 
  the main community keypair.
- **Multiple award authorities:** Different badges can be managed by different pubkeys, allowing delegation of membership management.
- **Cold storage for community key:** The main community keypair can remain in cold storage, only used for updating the community definition event.

Example:
 A community's "member" badge could be defined and awarded by a separate
 "membership-bot" pubkey that processes applications automatically, 
while the community's main key stays secure offline.

## [Comments, Reactions, Labels, and Zaps](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#comments-reactions-labels-and-zaps)

Communities
 SHOULD include a "General" content section that handles comments 
([[kind-1111]]), reactions ([[kind-7]]), and labels ([[kind-1985]]) with
 one shared profile list and badge. This allows members to interact with
 community content.

When a publication targets multiple communities, members from all those communities participate together:

**Comments, reactions, and labels** — filter by the General section's profile list from all targeted 
communities. Members from different communities meet in one shared 
discussion around the publication. No duplicates, no fragmented 
conversations across multiple places.

NOTE: 
Communities that don't want to be part of discussions with certain other
 communities can just not accept the events regarding them.

**Zaps** — anyone can zap community content. Query zap receipts on the community
 relays. No filtering — external appreciation is always welcome.

## [Implementation Notes](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#implementation-notes)

Unlike [[NIP-29]] (Relay-based Groups), Communikeys work on **any standard Nostr relay**. Access control is enforced client-side, not by relays (although they can of course optimize for it).

**Client filtering workflow:**

1. Fetch the community's [[kind-10222]] event to get content sections and their `k` tags
2. Fetch the profile list referenced in each content section's `a` tag to get whitelisted pubkeys
3. Query for events of those kinds targeting the community (via `h` tag or Targeted Publication), filtering by the whitelisted pubkeys using the `authors` filter

**Media fallback:**

Community
 blossom servers SHOULD back up all media files referenced in community 
publications — even when the original URLs point to different servers. 
By storing files by their content hash, the community server becomes a 
reliable fallback when external URLs suffer link rot. Clients can try 
the community's blossom server when the original media URL fails.

**Additional recommendations:**

- Clients MAY cache community metadata and badge awards to reduce relay queries
- Clients SHOULD check badge requirements before attempting to publish
- Relays MAY optionally verify badge requirements or implement retention policies, but this is not required

## [Benefits](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp22rfmsktmgpk2rtan7zwu00zuzax5maq5dnsu5g3xxvqr2u3pd7qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyd968gmewwp6kyqq0de5hqttrdakk6atwd94k27tnmznfzp#benefits)

1. No special relay required — works on any standard Nostr relay, unlike [[NIP-29]]
2. Easy onboarding — new users 
  don't need to set up any personal relay or media server to join Nostr 
  via a community. They can use the community's relay and blossom server 
  immediately.
3. Any existing npub can become a community
4. Any existing publication can be targeted at communities (backwards compatible)
5. Communities are not permanently tied to specific relays
6. Communities can define their own content types with badge-based access control
7. Cross-community interaction via Targeted Publications
8. Users can request access by submitting Form Responses
9. Delegated badge awarding — separate keys can handle membership without exposing the main community keypair
